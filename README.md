# CC-Search addon for GSuite

## This is an addon in development for Google Slides and Google Docs
The idea is that the user should be able to search for images licensed by CC and easily insert
them into the current slide/doc along with proper attribution.

Built using [Catalog API](https://github.com/creativecommons/cccatalog-api)
and leveraging [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/)
to integrate into Google Apps.

Creative Commons [CC Search](https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org/) is the official
frontend for the API. 

Inspiration for this project originally came from [GSoC 2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)
and the lack of decent image searching add-ons in the store.
